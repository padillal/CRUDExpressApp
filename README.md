**MyBook - A simple CRUD application**

This application utilizes the functions of create, read, update, and delete to modify profile elements in a database.

Each profile follows a basic schema, composing of a simple name, status, and id. These profiles are then stored in a mongodb database to be referenced and acted upon by one of the CRUD functions.

The application is separated in multiple parts, the main ones being models, views, controllers, and routes.
